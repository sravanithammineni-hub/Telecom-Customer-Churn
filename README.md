# Telecom-Customer-Churn
Customer churn analysis project combining Python-based machine learning and Power BI dashboards to predict churn and support data-driven retention strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company to identify
key factors that lead to customer attrition and provide actionable
business recommendations.

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify churned customers
- Understand churn drivers
- Predict customer churn using Machine Learning
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## 📊 Dashboard Pages
1. Churn_Overview (KPIs, churn rate)
2. Churn_Drivers (Contract, Payment Method, Internet Service)
3. Tenure_and_Charges_Analysis
4. Customer_Segmentation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Scaling: StandardScaler
- Model Accuracy: 78% 

## 📈 Key Insights
- Month-to-month customers churn more
- High monthly charges increase churn
- New customers are high-risk
- Auto-payment reduces churn

## ✅ Recommendations
- Promote long-term contracts
- Offer discounts to new users
- Encourage auto-pay methods
- Improve customer support
